I'm a Software Engineer with a knack for tinkering and a never-ending curiosity about how things work in the computer science world. This blog is where I document my experiments â€“ diving deep into various algorithms, data science techniques, and building prototypes to tackle exciting challenges.

My background includes a Masters in Computer Science from Arizona State University and 7 years of industry experience, most recently at Amazon's Seller Partner Financial Technology org. I love to solve challenging engineering problems, and to explain them clearly.

I enjoy watching movies, drawing, and listening to music as well. If you have any questions, comments, or just want to chat tech, hit me up at [krishna{dot}pingal{at}gmail{dot}com](mailto:krishna.pingal@gmail.com)
